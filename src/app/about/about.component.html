      <div class="about-main-text">After over 20 years of running my own business in interior design
        with up to 20 employees, it was time to do something different. <br> I remembered my early
        enthusiasm for programming and decided to make it my new soul task. <br> So I began to study
        many areas of IT like system integration, cryptography, coding and web design. <br> Finally,
        at the end of
        2022, I was good enough to offer my services to the world as a
        freelancer: Hello world.
